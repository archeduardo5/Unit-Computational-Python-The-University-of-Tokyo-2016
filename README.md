# Rhino Python Lecture - Day 1: Introduction to Python

## 1. Introduction to Programming Language

### 1.1 What is Python?

In the vast world of programming languages, there are multiple options such as C, C++, C#, Java, Scala, Go, Rust, Ruby, and Python. Each of these languages has unique characteristics that make them special for different purposes.

### 1.2 Programming Language Classification

#### Compiled Languages
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Require a compilation process before execution
  - Compilation translates code into machine language (binary sequences of 0 and 1)
  - Generally offer higher performance and execution speed
- **Examples**: C, C++, C#, Java, Scala, Go, Rust

#### Scripting Languages
- **Characteristics**:
  - Do not require a visible compilation process
  - Compiled at runtime through an interpreter
  - Allow faster code execution and testing
- **Examples**: Ruby, Python


### 1.3 Advantages of Python as a Scripting Language
- Faster and more agile development
- Ease of testing and code revision
- Clear and readable syntax
- Extensive libraries and frameworks
